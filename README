ES6: Create a JavaScript Promise
A promise in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like - you use it to 
make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task 
completes, you either fulfill your promise or fail to do so. Promise is
 a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one.
  It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject. 
These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise.

ES6: Handle a Fulfilled Promise with then
Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown 
amount of time in your code (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server 
request. When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, and 
after it completes you usually want to do something with the response 
from the server. This can be achieved by using the then method. 
The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled 
with resolve.
